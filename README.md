# imgup-rs

This is a Rust CLI tool for pushing image files up to imgur and copying the URL to the system clipboard.

## Example
Usage:
```bash
$ imgup ~/pictures/file.jpg
```
Output:
```bash
https://i.imgur.com/rnSZuQH.jpg
Delete hash: <hash>
```

## Notes

Currently does not support copying URL to clipboard.

## TODO

- [x] Enable image upload
- [ ] Enable copying URL to clipboard

although you can just copy the url to your clipboard yourself
